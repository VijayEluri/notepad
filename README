Feature checklist

- Mandatory Feature MenuBar (pre-coded by code author)
- Optional About
- Mandatory Feature TextRaw
- Mandatory Input (Has been inserted into code as an optional variable to identify difficulties)
- Optional SaveAs (requires Input as it uses InputActions class, consequently this feature has no Action class)
- Optional Warn unsaved files (Refer to github commits or to rationale to see how to implement this feature, sligh different way)

Obs: Output features has turned into Mandatory so application can warn users that text on TextRaw feature has not been saved.
A different version without this 'extra warn feature' can be seen on the author Ian version.
